**Action**: Update your `README.md` file with the above content to provide a comprehensive overview of your project.

### 2. Add a Circuit Diagram

Including a visual representation of your circuit enhances understanding. You can create one using tools like [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) or [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits).

**Action**: Create and upload a circuit diagram image to your repository.

### 3. Include a Demonstration Video

A short video demonstrating your project in action can be very impactful.

**Action**: Record a brief video showing the clap-activated light in operation and add the link to your README under a "Demo" section.

### 4. Improve Code Documentation

Adding comments to your code helps others (and future you) understand the logic.

**Action**: Update your `clap_light.ino` file with comments explaining each section of the code.
